s:2007:"<p></p><p><strong>How do I pass the course?</strong></p><p>To earn your Course Certificate, you’ll need to earn a passing grade on each of the required assignments—these can be quizzes, peer-graded assignments, or programming assignments. Videos, readings, and practice exercises are there to help you prepare for the graded assignments.</p><p><strong>What do start dates and end dates mean?</strong></p><p>Most courses have sessions that run multiple times a year — each with a specific start and end date. Once you enroll, you’ll have access to all videos, readings, quizzes, and programming assignments (if applicable). Peer-graded assignments can only be submitted and reviewed once your session has begun. If you choose to explore the course without purchasing, you may not be able to access certain assignments. If you don’t finish all graded assignments before the end of the session, you can enroll in the next session. Your progress will be saved and you’ll be able to pick up where you left off when the next session begins.</p><p><strong>What are due dates? Is there a penalty for submitting my work after a due date?</strong></p><p>Within each session, there are suggested due dates to help you manage your schedule and keep coursework from piling up. Quizzes and programming assignments can be submitted late without consequence. However, it is possible that you won't receive a grade if you submit your peer-graded assignment too late because classmates usually review assignment within three days of the assignment deadline.</p><p><strong>Can I re-attempt an assignment?</strong></p><p>Yes. If you want to improve your grade, you can always try again. If you’re re-attempting a peer-graded assignment, re-submit your work as soon as you can to make sure there’s enough time for your classmates to review your work. In some cases you may need to wait before re-submitting a programming assignment or quiz. We encourage you to review course material during this delay.</p><br />";
